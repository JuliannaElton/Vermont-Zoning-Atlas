I think we should treat it the way it is treated by the zoning regulations. What you've done works. YB",,f,f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regarding PUDs/PRDs: I'm not sure how to code this. The base density is 1 unit/acre with a minimum lot size of 1 acre, but multiple unit dwellings are permitted on this lot size at a higher density. PUDs are approved at the same density as regular lots, but are given more flexibility as to how to allocate their space. GS

I'm going to ask Emily to weigh in on this. Good question! YB

BH - They don't give the developer much incentive.  The way you have it coded is correct.",,f,f,1.0,0.2,75.0,15.0,30.0,,,,,t,f,,35.0,,,,,1.0,100.0,100.0,100.0,100.0,100.0,f,,t,t,
