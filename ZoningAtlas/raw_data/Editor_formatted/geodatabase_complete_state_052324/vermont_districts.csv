ES - my read here is that new development is prohibited, including any accessory structures. The permit process and conditional use review are for minor improvements or substantial improvements to existing structures - substantial improvements being something that is defined by FEMA as improvements costing >50% of the value of the property. Makes sense to confirm with zoning administrator before I approve.

ES - See the table in Section 622.III.D - sf and duplex require the same min lot size. My read on min. lot size is that it remains the 4,000SF for 3+ family as well, see section 747: ""In the MU, HI and CBD Districts, subject to conditional use approval in accordance with Section 540, dwelling units may be added notwithstanding lot area. The other dimensional requirements of Section 620 remain in effect and may constrain the development potential of the parcel.""  Basically I think conditional use approval is the process by which appropriateness of proposed density over 3 families is determined. And of course maximum building footprint plays a role here too. 
Let's confirm with the zoning administrator.
