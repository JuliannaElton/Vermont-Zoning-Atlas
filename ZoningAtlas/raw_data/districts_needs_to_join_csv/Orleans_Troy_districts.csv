Notes - Write any explanations here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"All development requires a permit from the ZA. Development within designated centers allowed if it is not closer to the river than pre-existing structures; otherwise, development must be located within 300' of pre-existing structures and accessory structures must be located directly behind and further from river than primary structure. If neither of those are met, the development must be proven to not be placed on land with a history of flood erosion, does not alter the river's width/depth/meander pattern, and does not require stream channelization. Full details in Section 204.7 of zoning bylaws.",
