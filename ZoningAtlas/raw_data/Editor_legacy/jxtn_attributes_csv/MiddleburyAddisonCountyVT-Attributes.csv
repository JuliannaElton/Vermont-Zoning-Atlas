The VT Open geodata portal lists a Source Protection Overlay District that is not mentioned in the regulations, and the regulations reference special provisions for development adjacent to Route 7, wetlands, riparian areas, farms, wildlife habitats, and scenic views that are not specifically designated as overlays."
