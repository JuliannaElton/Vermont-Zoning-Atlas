Notes - Write any explanations here.,"ADUs become a conditional use when ""a new accessory structure [is] constructed after the enactment of these Zoning Regulations, or An increase in the height or floor area of the existing dwelling [occurs]""",,"Peacham's definition of ""dwelling, multi-family"" simply states ""more than three families,"" which is taken to include buildings housing 5+ families. As in the RD, ADUs become a conditional use in the VD when ""A new accessory structure [is] constructed after the enactment of these Zoning Regulations, or An increase in the height or floor area of the existing dwelling [occurs]""",,"ADUs become a conditional use when ""A new accessory structure [is] constructed after the enactment of these Zoning Regulations, or An increase in the height or floor area of the existing dwelling [occurs]""",,"ADUs become a conditional use when ""A new accessory structure [is] constructed after the enactment of these Zoning Regulations, or An increase in the height or floor area of the existing dwelling [occurs]""",,"PUD approval required for subdivision of three or more parcels. ADUs become a conditional use when ""A new accessory structure [is] constructed after the enactment of these Zoning Regulations, or An increase in the height or floor area of the existing dwelling [occurs]""",,"Although the WH district does modify permissible uses in underlying areas, the zoning code provides no dimensional standards for single-family development in the overlay. I am guessing that dimensional standards remain unchanged in the WH district and thus all that changes is the prohibition of other uses.",
