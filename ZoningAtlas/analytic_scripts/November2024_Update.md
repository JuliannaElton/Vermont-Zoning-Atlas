# VT Zoning Atlas - Review and Updates 
An updated & simplified version of the statewide VT zoning atlas data is available here:
https://files.vcgi.vermont.gov/data/Zoning/VT_Zoning_Atlas.geojson

A demo application with the data is available at https://zoning.mapvt.com
(Please note that this map is intended for educational purposes, the analysis is not perfect, and zoning bylaws may have changed since the data was compiled.)

## Summary of updates: 
-	**Multi-Family/4D** The National Zoning Atlas definition of an “Allowed/Conditional” use means that it is allowed without a public hearing - while it means the opposite in Vermont (See 24 VSA § 4414. Zoning; permissible types of regulations 3) Conditional Uses are "allowed only by approval of the appropriate municipal panel". This likely caused some ‘4FD’ to be misclassified as ‘Permitted’ instead of ‘Public Hearing’. 300 districts were reviewed and 200 were found to be misclassified. See detailed table below.
-	**Topology cleanup/ simplification.** Geometry collected from municipalities was also modified to repair significant topology issues and simplified to improve layer performance. File size was reduced from a 193MB geojson file to 35MB. 

Review and updates were performed by the Vermont Center for Geographic Information in November 2024 using the VTZA_zoned_jxtns_08012024_final.geojson file in this repo.

## District Updates 
Districts identified as misclassified (Y) has the ‘4FD’ Field updated from permitted to public hearing. This was done in the statewide version only.
