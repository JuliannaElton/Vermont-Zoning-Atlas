A majority of the district is mapped on flood-prone land identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency on the Flood Insurance Rate Map dated 9/27/85, currently in effect in Cornwall. Such lands are located along the Lemon Fair River in the northwestern portion of Cornwall and in a major swamp
area adjacent to Otter Creek in the eastern area of Town and are subject to the regulations of ARTICLE IX of this document. The purposes of this district are to protect significant wildlife and natural resource values; to
restrict development opportunities due to limiting physical conditions; to prevent increases in flooding due to excess development; and to minimize losses due to floods. Consequently, only very limited uses are
permitted by right, while structural improvements require conditional use approval, with a minimum lot size for all uses of 25 acres.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.04,400,400,,,,,,f,,

Architectural styles similar to those typical of the town’s historic farmsteads should be encouraged. Use of PUDs and conservation subdivision principles should be encouraged and rural amenities, such as trails,
should be incorporated into major subdivisions. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.25,300,300,300.0,300.0,300.0,f,,t,,
