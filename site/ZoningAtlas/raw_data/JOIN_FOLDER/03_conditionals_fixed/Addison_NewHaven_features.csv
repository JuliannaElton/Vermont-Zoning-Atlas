This is a nonresidential district, but nothing prohibits PUDs and mobile home parks in this district...

BH - this is definitely an industrial district with only industrial and some commercial activities allowed.  mobile homes are residential and PUDs have residential as well.  I think it's correct the way you have it coded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,f,,f,f,
