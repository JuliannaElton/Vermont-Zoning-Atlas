# Vermont Zoning Atlas
The Vermont Zoning Atlas is a database and web tool that brings together zoning laws from 1,755 districts across the state of Vermont. Its goal is to help answer fundamental questions facing cities and towns: for the land that we have, what can be built?

Zoning laws regulate the types of housing that can be built. But for ordinary people, they can be complex, overwhelming, and hard to find. The Vermont Zoning Atlas takes inspiration from the National Zoning Atlas project to "digitize, demystify, and democratize information" that is often hidden under many layers of hard to parse paperwork.

As a rural state, Vermont's zoning laws can be especially difficult to find and understand. Many towns use their own methods of record keeping and governance. But we believe that universal access to this information is critical for smart community growth.
