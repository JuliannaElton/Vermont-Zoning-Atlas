",,PUD permitted uses are the uses permitted in the proposed districts,,PUD permitted uses are the uses permitted in the proposed districts,,Lot size can be waived to no less than 1 acre provided that overall permittable density on the lot stays the same (according to table 7.1),,Administrative officer/board of approval must find that any new development in the DWA has minimized impacts on deer wintering. Administrative officer approval when only a zoning permit is needed for development and BOA when conditional use (public hearing) is needed.,,,,,,"Any changes to existing structures must be approved by the planning commission, including additions, alterations, demolition, and relocation of the structure. Change of use/occupancy and routine repairs not affecting the outside of the structure do not require approval. Specific details found in Section 3.13 of bylaws.",,,,The overlay consists of designated wetlands and 50' surrounding the wetlands.
