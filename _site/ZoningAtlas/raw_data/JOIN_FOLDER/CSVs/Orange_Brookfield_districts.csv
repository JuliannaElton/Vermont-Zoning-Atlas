Development in the floodway areas is prohibited unless proven to not affect base flood levels by an engineer. Residential and commercial development in special flood hazard areas must be elevated to or above the base flood elevation; all development in special flood hazard areas must be anchored to prevent movement during flooding, constructed with materials resistant to flood damage and with methods that minimize damage, and heating/electricity/plumbing/etc. located so as to prevent water from entering during flooding.",,Public parks and recreation - specific permitted and conditional uses in Section 2.1.D.,,"Area around Sunset Lake zoned as general development, areas around Baker, Lamson, North and Rood Ponds classified as recreational. Overlay allows 1-family treatment in underlying districts that also permit this with specified setbacks; 2-family treatment under this overlay requires a public hearing. Required erosion protection measured can be found in the Shoreland Bylaws document Article VI.",,Overlay allows 1-family treatment with public hearing in base districts that also permit 1-family treatment. ,
